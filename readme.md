# FingerprintJS

Welcome to the world of FingerprintJS open source software. This is the home repository where you can get up to speed in minutes. In the [wiki section](https://github.com/FingerprintJS/Home/wiki) of this repository, you can find the best practices and guidelines for open source projects.
  
## Our highlighted products and related open-source projects
  
### FingerprintJS
  
[FingerprintJS](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs) is a browser fingerprinting library that queries browser attributes and computes a hashed visitor identifier from them. Unlike cookies and local storage, a fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when browser data is purged.

### FingerptintJS PRO
  
[FingerprintJS PRO](https://fingerprintjs.com/) offers highly accurate browser fingerprinting technology (99.5%) and is used by over 8,000 websites. It can verify legitimate users and block fraudsters even if they use VPNs, private browsing, clear cookies, or other methods to hide. FingerprintJS PRO helps websites secure their login, checkout and other pages from fraudulent login attempts, credit card fraud, cheating on online platforms and more by uniquely identifying every browser that connects to your website.

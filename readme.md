# FingerprintJS

Welcome to the world of FingerprintJS open-source software. This is the home repository where you can get up to speed in minutes. In the [wiki section](https://github.com/FingerprintJS/Home/wiki) of this repository, you can find the best practices and guidelines for open-source projects. 

[FingerprintJS](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs) is a browser fingerprinting library that queries browser attributes and computes a hashed visitor identifier from them. Unlike cookies and local storage, a fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when browser data is purged.

### Fingerprint Pro

[Fingerprint Pro](https://fingerprint.com/github/) offers highly accurate browser fingerprinting technology (99.5%) and is used by over 8,000 websites. It can verify legitimate users and block fraudsters even if they use VPNs, browse in incognito mode, clear their cookies, or use other methods to hide their identity. Fingerprint Pro helps companies prevent fraud, improve user experiences, and better understand their traffic.

Fingerprint Pro builds on the FingerprintJS browser fingerprint library to provide up to 99.5% accurate device identification. Key capabilities include:

- Cookie and local storage management - Leverages cryptographically signed cookies and local storage to reliably associate visitor identifier values with fingerprintable attributes.
- Server-side analysis and machine learning - Provides a holistic view of all attributes and layers to generate the most stable and accurate visitor ID.
- Storage and deduplication - Collects multiple attributes to do fuzzy matching and handle browser and OS upgrades.
- Native [iOS](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-android-demo) libraries - Enables accurate iOS and Android application user identification with the native platform-specific library, or with the webview integration. These integrations work together with Fingerprint Pro API.

### Fingerprint Pro Plus
Fingerprint Pro Plus expands on Fingerprint Proâ€™s identification via the visitor ID and adds Smart Signals for enhanced fraud detection and prevention. Fingerprint Pro Plus is geared toward businesses that need additional tools to understand their anonymous users, identify malicious users, and prevent fraud. Fingerprint Pro Plus provides the visitor ID, a unique identifier, and combines that with Smart Signals to tackle your anti-fraud use cases. 

#### Smart Signals 

[Smart Signals](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/smart-signals-overview) are an extensive set of signals, not used in traditional identification processes, that are used to identify anonymous visitors attempting to perform fraudulent activities enabling you to identify them with confidence while providing a frictionless, positive experience for trusted visitors. 

- Browser bot detection
- Incognito mode detection
- IP geolocation
- VPN detection
- Browser tamper detection
- Virtual machine detection
- Privacy-focused settings detection
- Developer tools detection

- Raw device attributes
- Android emulator detection
- Android tamper detection
- Android cloned app detection
- Factory reset detection
- Frida detection
- Geolocation spoofing detection
- Jailbroken iOS device detection
